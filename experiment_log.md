## Experiment 1: 7-Scenario Benchmark Suite

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/benchmark.py --save-json results.json`
**Duration:** ~49 minutes (2916s wall time)
**Hardware:** Local Ollama, deepseek-r1:8b + mxbai-embed-large

**What:** Ran both Standard RAG and Neurosymbolic RAG across 7 scenarios (physics, pharmacology, supply chain, environmental science, engineering, microbiology, solar physics), each with 12-14 corpus sentences including designed distractors.

**Key findings:**
- NS wins 3/7 (everest +25%, drug +20%, economic +50%), ties 2/7, loses 2/7
- Mean coverage: Std 62% vs NS 69% (+6% delta)
- NS wins come from entity bridging recovering low-similarity chain steps
- NS losses trace to extraction model (deepseek-r1:8b) producing degenerate triples on technical sentences
- 16.9x time overhead (mostly extraction LLM calls)

**Artifacts:**
- `results.json` — Full per-scenario metrics
- `exploration_notes.md` §1 — Narrative analysis

## Experiment 2: Embedding Geometry — 5 Proposition Families

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/explore_embeddings.py`
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

**What:** Embedded 5 families of propositions with mxbai-embed-large (1024-dim) to understand how embedding space encodes semantic relationships. Families: "X are cute" (5 variants), Socrates syllogism (3), Robin syllogism (3), causal chain (3), "X inhibits Y" (4).

**Key findings:**
- Near-synonyms (Dogs/Canines) cluster at 0.976 — embedding space handles lexical substitution well
- Syllogism premises are far apart (0.560 for Socrates) — the logical bridge is the weakest link in embedding space
- Causal chain endpoints (0.476) are barely above noise — confirms multi-hop retrieval gap
- Shared predicate ("inhibits") gives only 0.450 mean similarity — embeddings encode domain content, not relational structure
- Subject overlap drives similarity more than predicate or object overlap

**Artifacts:**
- `prototype/embeddings_exploration.npz` — Raw 1024-dim vectors for all 18 propositions
- `prototype/embeddings_exploration.json` — Pairwise similarity matrices
- `exploration_notes.md` §2 — Full interpretation

## Experiment 3: Semantic Grid — Subject/Predicate/Object Axis Isolation

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/semantic_grid.py`

**What:** Systematic 3x3x3 grid of 27 propositions formed by crossing 3 subjects × 3 predicates × 3 objects, using maximally unambiguous concrete nouns and clear action verbs. Goal: isolate how much each semantic role (S, P, O) contributes to embedding distance.

**Grid:** 3 subjects (cats, trucks, children) × 3 predicates (eat, carry, watch) × 3 objects (fish, rocks, stars) = 27 propositions.

**Key findings:**
- Subject is the strongest axis: sharing a subject gives +0.240 separation (same=0.702 vs diff=0.462)
- Object is second: +0.176 separation (same=0.658 vs diff=0.482)
- Predicate is weakest by far: +0.069 separation (same=0.583 vs diff=0.515)
- Hierarchy: subject (3.5x) > object (2.6x) > predicate (1.0x) in pull strength
- Joint analysis: 0 shared axes → 0.361 mean, 1 shared → 0.546, 2 shared → 0.750
- Per-value: "trucks" pulls hardest among subjects (+0.267), "children" weakest (+0.201)
- Predicates are nearly interchangeable in embedding space (all ~0.07 pull)
- Most similar: "Trucks carry stars" / "Trucks watch stars" = 0.915 (subject+object shared, predicate differs)
- Least similar: "Cats eat fish" / "Children watch stars" = 0.247 (nothing shared)

**Artifacts:**

## Experiment 4: Verb Structure — Predicate Directional Consistency

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/verb_structure.py`
**Duration:** <1 second (reuses grid embeddings)

**What:** Deep analysis of predicate effects on embeddings. Four analyses: (1) verb displacement vector consistency across S/O contexts, (2) verb-conditioned subspace correlation, (3) naturalness/selectional preference encoding, (4) S×P and P×O interaction effects.

**Key findings:**
- Verb displacements ARE directionally consistent: eat→carry has 0.671 mean pairwise cosine of displacement vectors, 0.841 alignment to mean direction
- Displacement consistency is higher when subject is shared (0.769) vs neither shared (0.601)
- Verb-conditioned subspace geometry is nearly identical: Pearson r=0.958 between eat and carry internal structures
- Verbs translate the S/O cluster without deforming it
- Naturalness not encoded: overall correlation r=-0.031 between hand-labeled naturalness and centroid distance
- S×P and P×O interaction effects are minimal (all 0.70-0.77)
- Compositionality is real but lopsided: S + P + O combine approximately additively with unequal weights

## Experiment 5: Word Isolation & Taxonomic Jitter

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/word_isolation.py`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

**What:** Four-part analysis. (1) Grid words embedded in isolation to compare word-level vs proposition-level similarity. (2) Taxonomic hierarchies (dog→hound→canine→mammal→animal→creature, plus fish, rock, verb synonyms) embedded in isolation. (3) Jitter: substitute hierarchy words into proposition templates and measure whether word-level distance predicts sentence-level distance. (4) Convergence: do dog→animal and cat→animal converge at shared superclasses?

**Key findings:**

*Part 1 — Isolated grid words:*
- Within-role similarity: predicates (0.639) > objects (0.618) > subjects (0.545)
- This REVERSES the proposition-level hierarchy (subjects strongest in propositions)
- Predicates are more similar to each other as bare words, yet weakest in proposition pull
- "eat" and "fish" have highest cross-role similarity (0.708) — strong collocational association

*Part 2 — Taxonomic hierarchies:*
- dog/canine: 0.947 (near-synonyms, highest in any hierarchy)
- cat/feline: 0.923 (also near-synonyms)
- Adjacent hierarchy steps: mean ~0.82 (animals), ~0.72 (objects)
- Endpoints: puppy→creature 0.619, trout→thing 0.506 (clear taxonomic decay)
- Verb synonyms: eat family (0.741) > watch family (0.718) > carry family (0.653)

*Part 3 — Jitter in propositions:*
- Word↔sentence correlation is HIGH: subject jitter r=0.91, predicate r=0.92, object r=0.76
- Context compresses distances: predicate jitter most compressed (0.16-0.63), subject least (0.49-0.66)
- Predicate synonyms in context are almost invisible: "Cats eat fish" vs "Cats devour fish" = 0.965, "Cats munch fish" = 0.925 — all >0.92
- Subject hierarchy preserves relative ordering in all 3 templates (r>0.86)

*Part 4 — Hierarchy convergence:*
- dog→animal (0.876) vs cat→animal (0.769): dogs closer to "animal" than cats
- creature↔thing: 0.738 — near-universal hypernyms converge
- dog↔cat at base level: 0.691, but at mammal level: 1.000 (shared word), at animal level: also 1.000
- Convergence is literal (shared words) not graduated — the model doesn't smoothly merge unrelated hierarchies

*Part 5 — Distributional vs Ontological Semantics (qualitative finding):*
- dog→animal (0.876) > dog→mammal (0.816) despite mammal being taxonomically closer
- Embedding distance reflects word co-occurrence frequency, not formal taxonomic distance
- Words carry register baggage: "dog"/"cat" (informal) vs "feline"/"canine" (taxonomic) vs "carnivoran" (scientific)
- Hierarchy convergence is literal (shared word = 1.000) not graduated
- This reinforces the VKG's role: impose logical structure that embedding space can't represent

## Experiment 6: Taxonomic Direction — Universal "Up" in Embedding Space

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Script:** `python prototype/taxonomic_direction.py`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

**What:** Tested whether there is a consistent "upward" displacement vector when moving from specific→general along taxonomic hierarchies. 24 hierarchies (10 nouns, 10 verbs, 4 adjectives), 111 unique words. Five analyses: within-hierarchy displacement consistency, cross-hierarchy direction comparison, cross-POS alignment, abstraction-level clustering, and distance decay monotonicity.

**Key findings:**

*1. Within-hierarchy "up" is barely consistent:*
- Mean alignment to own mean direction: nouns 0.24, verbs 0.23, adj 0.33
- Pairwise step consistency near zero or negative for all POS types
- First and last steps most aligned; middle steps chaotic

*2. Nouns share more "up" direction than verbs:*
- Noun × Noun: 0.465 (dog↔horse: 0.696, dog↔cat: 0.677)
- Verb × Verb: 0.381 (eat↔devour: 0.557, eat↔listen: 0.292)
- Adj × Adj: 0.057 (essentially zero)
- Cross-POS: 0.03-0.06 (no universal abstraction axis)

*3. Distance decay is non-monotonic:*
- Only 4/24 hierarchies show monotonic decay from origin
- Nouns: 3/10 monotonic (16 violations), Verbs: 1/10 (14), Adj: 0/4 (4)
- Violations follow the distributional pattern: casual words bounce back, technical terms dip
- puppy→canine (0.856) > hound (0.723); puppy→animal (0.745) > mammal (0.676)

*4. Verb hierarchies are genuinely messier:*
- Lower cross-hierarchy agreement (0.381 vs nouns' 0.465)
- More violations of monotonic decay
- Confirms user's intuition that verbs are less taxonomically organized

*5. Same-level words do NOT cluster:*
- Within-level sim (0.553-0.585) ≈ cross-level sim (0.558-0.580)
- No abstraction-level clustering exists in embedding space

*6. Global "up" = noun abstraction direction:*
- Global magnitude: 0.456
- Nouns align at 0.541, verbs at 0.480, adj at 0.181
- The "global up" is dominated by noun hierarchies sharing upper levels
